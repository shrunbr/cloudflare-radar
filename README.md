# Cloudflare Radar

*The unofficial API documentation/Postman collection for Cloudflare Radar*

## Getting Started

To get started download the "*Cloudflare Radar.postman_collection.json*" file and import it into Postman. You'll want to run the __GET__ request for "Categories" (located under Domain Specific) first so that the test applied to that request can set the API token for the rest of the collection. The API tokens appear to be valid for around an hour.

If you do not have a Postman account you can get one for free by registering at https://www.postman.com.
